    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 1 over of this challenge. So far so good, the commitment required seems bearable, and to be honest it&rsquo;s a great way to take the mind off the other stuff.
I&rsquo;m still not sure about the general style of the icons though. So far I opted for large icons, with a fair amount of details, outlined with two possible stroke widths (4px and 2px). I&rsquo;m not sure about this, they might look good on a landing page or a dashboard, but they&rsquo;ll probably look off on a smaller scale in an app.<br/>
I&rsquo;m probably going to switch style the next month or further up down the road, but for now, they&rsquo;ll do.</p>

<p>Until next time</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>&ldquo;This year is the year. The year when I actually take my new year&rsquo;s resolution to its completion&rdquo;</em>. That&rsquo;s what I tell myself every year. Last year I started a new resolution: post an article a month on this blog. Well&hellip; that went great as you can see, although it was a nice experience being on the first page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8010233">Hacker News</a> for a brief period. <!-- More -->
I did try my best, but sometimes life hits you like a ton of bricks. Feeling swarmed I opted to dedicate my spare time to my open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/andreamazz">Github</a>, leaving this blog rather sad and empty.<br/>
Anyway, since I&rsquo;m a creature of habit, I am here telling myself <em>&ldquo;This year is the year. the year when I actually take my new year&rsquo;s resolution to its completion&rdquo;</em>. Since I&rsquo;m an idiot I&rsquo;m about to pick a challenge worth 365 daily efforts instead of 12 monthly ones.
Before illustrating this year&rsquo;s challenge, I&rsquo;ll take a step back to explain my reasoning behind this. If you happened to read one of my previous post you might know that I&rsquo;m an iOS developer at heart, and sometimes I take a stab at UI design and Rails development. I feel like my iOS tools are moderately sharp (although I need to catch up on WatchKit and start taking Swift more seriously, i.e.: start using it for production code), unlike my designer&rsquo;s skills, that definitely need some polish. That&rsquo;s why this year&rsquo;s resolution will be covered by my favorite design tool, <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>.</p>

<h2>Designing an icon a day</h2>

<p>The other day I stumbled upon <a href="http://sensibleworld.com/news/year-of-icons/">this project</a>. A really simple idea (to describe): design an icon a day. I love this concept, for one I&rsquo;ll be able to practice designing vector shapes, and as icing on this slowly baked cake I&rsquo;ll end up with a bunch of (hopefully) reusable icons.
I was intrigued, so intrigued that I think this will be the perfect year-long project.
I can already hear future-me screaming in pain, calling me an idiot. Brilliant.</p>

<h2>How and where</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be using Sketch, and my main source of inspiration will be, at first, random words from a word generator.
I&rsquo;ll be posting the icons on my Github&rsquo;s profile, in <a href="https://github.com/andreamazz/one-icon-a-day">this repository</a>. The icons will be licensed under Creative Commons&rsquo;s Attribution 4.0 International licence.
The fun starts on January 1 2015. Future-me will hopefully stop this project on December 31 2015 maintaining a sizeable amount of sanity.</p>

<p>Untile next time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so going to botch this&hellip;</p>
