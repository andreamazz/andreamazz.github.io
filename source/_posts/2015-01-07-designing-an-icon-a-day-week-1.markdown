Week 1 over of this challenge. So far so good, the commitment required seems bearable, and to be honest it's a great way to take the mind off the other stuff. 
I'm still not sure about the general style of the icons though. So far I opted for large icons, with a fair amount of details, outlined with two possible stroke widths (4px and 2px). I'm not sure about this, they might look good on a landing page or a dashboard, but they'll probably look off on a smaller scale in an app.  
I'm probably going to switch style the next month or further up down the road, but for now, they'll do.  

Until next time
