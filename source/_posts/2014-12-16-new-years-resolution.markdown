_"This year is the year. The year when I actually take my new year's resolution to its completion"_. That's what I tell myself every year. Last year I started a new resolution: post an article a month on this blog. Well... that went great as you can see, although it was a nice experience being on the first page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8010233) for a brief period. <!-- More --> 
I did try my best, but sometimes life hits you like a ton of bricks. Feeling swarmed I opted to dedicate my spare time to my open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/andreamazz), leaving this blog rather sad and empty.  
Anyway, since I'm a creature of habit, I am here telling myself _"This year is the year. the year when I actually take my new year's resolution to its completion"_. Since I'm an idiot I'm about to pick a challenge worth 365 daily efforts instead of 12 monthly ones. 
Before illustrating this year's challenge, I'll take a step back to explain my reasoning behind this. If you happened to read one of my previous post you might know that I'm an iOS developer at heart, and sometimes I take a stab at UI design and Rails development. I feel like my iOS tools are moderately sharp (although I need to catch up on WatchKit and start taking Swift more seriously, i.e.: start using it for production code), unlike my designer's skills, that definitely need some polish. That's why this year's resolution will be covered by my favorite design tool, [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).  

##Designing an icon a day
The other day I stumbled upon [this project](http://sensibleworld.com/news/year-of-icons/). A really simple idea (to describe): design an icon a day. I love this concept, for one I'll be able to practice designing vector shapes, and as icing on this slowly baked cake I'll end up with a bunch of (hopefully) reusable icons. 
I was intrigued, so intrigued that I think this will be the perfect year-long project. 
I can already hear future-me screaming in pain, calling me an idiot. Brilliant.

##How and where
I'll be using Sketch, and my main source of inspiration will be, at first, random words from a word generator. 
I'll be posting the icons on my Github's profile, in [this repository](https://github.com/andreamazz/one-icon-a-day). The icons will be licensed under Creative Commons's Attribution 4.0 International licence.
The fun starts on January 1 2015. Future-me will hopefully stop this project on December 31 2015 maintaining a sizeable amount of sanity. 

Untile next time.

I'm so going to botch this...
