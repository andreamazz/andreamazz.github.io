Hi everyone. This blog is nothing more than a random collection of thoughts and snippets that might be usefull to other developers and, most of all, will be usefull to future me. 
<!-- more -->
I'm a software engineer, as you can guess from the blog's name I'm mostly an iOS developer, but I also like to mix stuff up in Ruby and occasionally with Android. I'm currently working as a developer at [Fancy Pixel](http://www.fancypixel.it), in the past I published some work as [Eflat Games](http://www.eflatgames.com). Also you'll find all my opensource projects on [Github](http://www.github.com/andreamazz).

Cheers,
Andrea.
