Hi everyone. This blog is nothing more than a random collection of thoughts and snippets that might be usefull to other developers and, most of all, will be usefull to _future_ me. 
<!-- more -->
I'm a software engineer, I work most of my time with Objective-C, but I also like to mix stuff up with Ruby and occasionally Android.  I'm a co-founder of [Fancy Pixel](http://www.fancypixel.it) where I work as developer. In the past I published some work as [Eflat Games](http://www.eflatgames.com). Also you'll find all my opensource projects on [Github](http://www.github.com/andreamazz).

Cheers,
Andrea.
